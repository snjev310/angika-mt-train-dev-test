# Angika MT Train Dev and Test Dataset

## Project Description
This repository contains training, development, and testing datasets for machine translation (MT) projects in the Angika language. 

- The **training dataset** consists of translations of the NLLB seed corpus.
- The **development (dev)** and **evaluation (devtest)** datasets are translations of the FLORES-200 dataset.

The goal of this repository is to support research and development in Angika language translation by providing high-quality data for training and evaluating MT models.

## Usage Instructions
- Clone this repository to your local machine:
  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/snjev310/angika-mt-train-test.git
  ```
- Use the provided datasets in your machine translation scripts or tools.
- Refer to the dataset details section below for understanding the organization and format of the data.
